        [Verse 1: Rustage & Shwabadi, Both]
        High Ki, we do it high key
        Superluminal, I'm moving up at light speed
        Look at my Ki, like high seas
        Got you riding my wave, when you try me
        Rivalry put behind me
        Binary can't divide me
        Fighting me?
        Make a crime scene
        So you'll cry and plead
        Like your nineteen
        Strike team, force of Earth, we're in sync like Gaia Knight
        Mighty, all your quirks can't save you, from the rising tide
        Bite me, Super Saiyan 4, you'll see my wild side
        Gassed up for the firefight, we blow it up like dynamite
        One finger take these rats out, put this pinkie to your brain
        If you're thinking we're the same, on the brink this ain't a game
        Rhett and Link how I stay mythical, morning
        Bet your kin now are so miserable, mourning
        This ain't a warning, duo is forming
        Heating your dome like it's global, warming
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Rustage & Shwabadi]
        This is something you ain't seen before
        Strapped up for the battle, coming at us, then we'll go to war
        Feel the power rushing to our core
        Thought we hit our limit?, bitch we didn't, bout to show you more

        [Chorus: Rustage & Shwabadi]
        Yah, one man but a unit
        Stand down or get clapped when we lose it
        Yah, big bang when we fuse it
        Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
        Yah, straight heat when we do shit
        Roll up, if the beat bangs we abuse it
        Yah, when mans looking stupid
        Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
        Yah, one man but a unit
        Stand down or get clapped when we lose it
        Yah, big bang when we fuse it
        Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
        Yah, straight heat when we do shit
        Roll up, if the beat bangs we abuse it
        Yah, when mans looking stupid
        Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
        
        [Verse 2: Rustage & Shwabadi, Both]
        One man but a unit
        Opps got no balls like a eunuch
        Square up, cubist
        Rearrange your block, Rubix
        Car seat how I boost shit
        Two heads like a Q-Tip
        Snap bones like a toothpick
        Send bald heads like a Buddhist
        Beyond God when the blue hits, bringing judgement like Anubis
        Ki flow, I'm too fluid uh, change shape but no druid
        Bring the magic, like we Penn and Teller, can't prove how we do this
        Beat you senseless, now you're Helen Keller, bitch, we're fucking ruthless
        Better than Vegito, bitch, I'm the one and only
        Legendary Super Saiyan, so I've overtaken Broly
        You want smoke, but you're choking
        Splayed out in the open
        Big Bang, Kamehameha, bring the explosion
        [Pre-Chorus: Rustage & Shwabadi]
        This is something you ain't seen before
        Strapped up for the battle, coming at us, then we'll go to war
        Feel the power rushing to our core
        Thought we hit our limit?, bitch we didn't, bout to show you more
        
        [Chorus: Rustage & Shwabadi]
        Yah, one man but a unit
        Stand down or get clapped when we lose it
        Yah, big bang when we fuse it
        Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
        Yah, straight heat when we do shit
        Roll up, if the beat bangs we abuse it
        Yah, when mans looking stupid
        Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
        Yah, one man but a unit
        Stand down or get clapped when we lose it
        Yah, big bang when we fuse it
        Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
        Yah, straight heat when we do shit
        Roll up, if the beat bangs we abuse it
        Yah, when mans looking stupid
        Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
