        [Verse 1 - Rustage: Naruto]
        Name on the book on the front page
        Turned a loser to a winner, call that chump change
        When I come of age I'm a hurricane
        Red clouds like mists when their blood sprays
        On the uptake, yeah, I'm gonna be
        So fit to lead, top of the Leaf, all victory
        Dropping the beat, no Killer B, can't stop the heat
        Stay clocking we Hickory Dickory
        Dock, Kaguya killing ya god, Kiba, I'll put out the dogs
        Sage and Hokage and child of prophecy, watch what I do like it's not even hard
        I do it non stop, when I'm unlocked, got the Chakra flow, no shackles
        Sasuke's run off, but the job's done when I hit em hard like a Yaoi paddle
        Minato in my blood and my DNA, these Tenseis ain't gonna be OK
        These Senseis say I'mma be so great, it's a piece of cake like I'm pre-ordained
        When I beat on Pain til he's KIA I'mma pave my way through the darkness
        Cus I'm making waves when I save the day, staying fresh like Ichiraku Ramen
        
        [Chorus - Rustage, Lex Bratcher, Shao Dow, NerdOut]
        Squad be putting in work, we turn it up, yuh
        Put my fist to the earth, we turn it up, yuh
        Make em bleed til it hurts, we turn it up, yuh
        Team Seven back in to battle, we turn it up, uh
        
        [Verse 2 - Lex Bratcher: Sakura]
        It's Sakura, got to give props to the Sannin who taught me the knowledge
        Of medical homage, but if it's not possible, Chakra control to hop over obstacles
        To be honest I'm on a roll like honor roll, best student, I'm so masterful
        I gots to use my Ninjutsu to get through and ruin Uchiha with a massive blow
        I'm like oh wow, they don't know how I be killing pros with my own sound
        Take you to the country, if you ain't ready for this rodeo, well it's gon be a hoe down
        Go loud, I got so much power within, Byakugou seal, my powers will win
        I don't talk trash, no I don't blow smoke, but if I do, then it's gon be a powerful wind
        Now look who I'm becoming, the realest and illest woman
        Breaking down the competition, Sasori don't even want it
        Get the memo, get to running, I'm hurting anyone coming
        For Team Seven, look you don't wanna be the one we hunting
        It seems heaven, is what you looking for if you are gunning
        You'll be severed and hurt before you even get two hundred
        Feet from us, you see son, you'll end up deceased
        We treat enemies like fleas and they flee from us

        [Chorus - Rustage, Lex Bratcher, Shao Dow, NerdOut]
        Squad be putting in work, we turn it up, yuh
        Put my fist to the earth, we turn it up, yuh
        Make em bleed til it hurts, we turn it up, yuh
        Team Seven back in to battle, we turn it up, uh
        
        [Verse 3 - Shao Dow: Sasuke]
        Now there's a lot of things I hate and few things that I'm liking
        I'm just surviving until the source of my hatred is dying
        So I seek the power that I need and this team is confining
        Try and read the right-ing on the wall or get left with the lightning
        Chidori sounding like the screams of my clan and my culture
        Wearing Uchiha on my back and their hate on my shoulders
        Now I'm surrounded by these snakes, they're behaving like vultures
        And all this vengeance is consuming me over and over
        Used to have the strongest vision, now I see darkness and heartache
        Living in the shadow of a brother who should've been Kage
        The ones I recognised the least are refusing to disregard me
        I wanna sever these bonds, so tell me why won't you discard me?
        
        [Chorus - Rustage, Lex Bratcher, Shao Dow, NerdOut]
        Squad be putting in work, we turn it up, yuh
        Put my fist to the earth, we turn it up, yuh
        Make em bleed til it hurts, we turn it up, yuh
        Team Seven back in to battle, we turn it up, uh
        [Verse 4 - NerdOut: Kakashi]
        Class is in session, you idiots need to listen up
        Don't ask me any questions about the mask or you'll be written up
        My orbital area's filled with Obito's Sharingan
        Now my left eye's glowing red like I smoked half of a Phillie Blunt
        I'll copy your moves like a Facsimile
        I'm like an encyclopedia of Jutsu's, that's a fact simile
        Can clearly see your next course of action before you step forward
        And use your own moves against you like a mirror on a chess board
        I'm that Ninja, beating me? That's a silly notion
        Throwin' walls up quicker than a brick-laying Mason guarding his emotions
        You know me, no need to name drop
        Chidori double tap to the chest, now who's says lightning doesn't strike twice in the same spot?
        
        [Chorus - Rustage, Lex Bratcher, Shao Dow, NerdOut]
        Squad be putting in work, we turn it up, yuh
        Put my fist to the earth, we turn it up, yuh
        Make em bleed til it hurts, we turn it up, yuh
        Team Seven back in to battle, we turn it up, uh
