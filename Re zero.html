    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <pre>
        [Verse 1: Rustage & LulunaRina]
Feel the pain that the past left, I will keep on fighting 'til my last breath
No witch forgets me, shadow of envy rip through my chest 'til my heart bled
Start again, learning the steps of the dance of death
Start again, timelines diverging to the darkest depths
Gasp for breath
I protect Emilia, breaking every boundary 'til I reach the end
We descend, take my life, I'll bleed instead, I'll clean this mess
Make sure they're free of dеath, I mean the best
Somеtimes I'm stuck on the fence
Problems won't work out the way I intend
Want to go back, there's still things to amend
How could these people forget about Rem?
We can't keep living in agony, I got these fears and my guilt that stay dragging me
I know I have to be pushing through tragedies, shoulder their burdens 'til I'm past capacity
They're like my family, they won't be casualties, witches and cultists, they have the audacity
Mess with mortality, I know it's selfish, but I'll keep on working to stop the catastrophe

[Chorus: McGwire]
Why do I lie awake in my bed, nightmares all around with no end
Now my spirit gets taken, I'm losing my faith and my morals get shaken
Live again and again in my head, I can't keep going 'til they end up dead
But my spirit's been breaking, my body's been shaking, don't know if I can take it

[Verse 2: Rustage & LulunaRina]
It might take a while, wanna see them smile, eyes are so kind, but their words are hostile
Turn back the dials, I'm just an outsider, they put their trust in me, I'll face the trials
Roswaal, they're acting like clowns, Emilia deserves the crown
You want to show me the outcome, there's tears in my sanity, 'bout to breakdown
Villains enter, live in terror
Elsa, when I pull up, I done did it better
Hidden pressure, give in error
Spirit like I'm Puck, I'm gonna flip the weather
Uh, I got more hunger than rabbits
Into my zone, this about to get graphic
Left 'em alone and they started to panic
Not of this world, but I don't need no magic
Vicious cycles, I'm done with witches disciples
I can not live in denial, I'm ready for my reprisal
I'm not suicidal, part of the plan, so my death is vital
Cause I'll keep it up determined, I will strive for our survival

[Bridge: Rustage & LulunaRina]
Feel the pain, rinse repeat
Mental strain, rinse repeat
Body drained, rinse repeat
Back again, rinse repeat

[Chorus: McGwire & LulunaRina]
Why do I lie awake in my bed, nightmares all around with no end
Now my spirit gets taken, I'm losing my faith and my morals get shaken
Live again and again in my head, I can't keep going 'til they end up dead
But my spirit's been breaking, my body's been shaking, don't know if I can take it
Live again and again in my head, I can't keep going 'til they end up dead
But my spirit's been breaking, my body's been shaking, don't know if I can take it

Rustage:
Feel the pain, rinse repeat
Mental strain, rinse repeat
Body drained, rinse repeat
Back again, rinse repeat
