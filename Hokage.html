        [Verse 1: Hashirama Senju (Rustage)]
        'Cause I'm the OG
        Ain't nobody be messing with me
        My legacy echoes through centuries
        Mention my name - the Hokage, the founder of the Hidden Leaf
        Upping the heat, wood release
        Healing my wounds, I can never be beat
        Victory? Easily, work like machinery
        Meeting the God of the Shinobi (uh)
        I grew up fighting, but working my way to peace (yuh)
        You grew up spiting and crying 'bout your beliefs (yuh)
        Battle me, I'm 'bout to be the baddest in the land
        Had a beef with Madara, but made him understand
        Ain't nobody toppin', I'm rockin' with my commands
        Gonna make a stand, several thousand hands (yuh)
        Absorbin' your Chakra, I'm on ya, regretting you'd came home (woo)
        Dishonour my people, you're feeble compared to my Sage Mode (oh)
        Repping my squad, binding the Gate of the Great God
        'Bout to show you what the seven Hokages are made of
        
        [Verse 2: Tobirama Senju (None Like Joshua)]
        Hashirama, man, that's the toughest act to follow
        Second Hokage of Konoha, yeah, it's Tobirama
        Test my Will of Fire, then I summon Dragon Water on ya
        I don't call the cops on Ninjas, I'm just hiring all Uchihas
        Damn, I don't like those Ninjas, cursed since they were babies
        But look, I got one as a student for diversity training
        Don't mean to sound like a Ninjist, but Madara, Obito, Itachi, Sasuke
        Certain on exterminating, surely I ain't hating
        Anyways, see, I'm that fastest Ninja
        Flying Raijin to ya
        And I taught him Sarutobi
        Everything he knew
        But Minato my Shadow Clone, so don't be tryna fool us
        Tsunade failed the Leaf, OK, but that's a woman
        Rise from the dead, and then I kill again 'cause they know that I'm the cruelest
        And then I'm back in paradise to infinitely slice Izuna

        [Verse 3: Hiruzen Sarutobi (GameboyJones)]
        Call me Sarutobi, brought up by the God Shinobi
        Then became the Third Hokage, that's how history will show me
        Gotta keep an eye on the people just like Danzo
        Yeah, I got that Ninjutsu, but I'll still give you combos
        Orochimaru came back to the Village just to make a statement
        So I had to take the First and Second when reanimated
        Three on one, man, this fight is harder every minute
        Past Orochimaru said if I was younger, I would kick his ass
        You ain't never seen me in my prime, mate
        Summoned up the Monkey King to hit you with this primate
        Who you think you kidding? I'm a living legend, probably the best still
        I will go out with a bang, using Reaper Death Seal
        
        [Verse 4: Minato Namikaze (Connor Quest!)]
        Flash of lightning, dash by striking
        Never see me coming, yeah, that's quite frightening
        Taking out an army, not a single one hit me
        Fist a millimeter from the face, still miss me
        I had aspired for reputation admired
        Kushina might think I look fly with some Hokage attire
        Yeah, Jiraiya, he thought highly of me, seen in my eyes that I had that fire
        He thought I could be that child that would save this world from a threat so dire
        Rin, Obito, Kakashi - I would train
        Three incredible students I would lead to the fray
        Split between keeping the peace in my team
        And I couldn't be there for the struggles they faced
        Fourth Hokage, I was born to partake
        In the gory parlay fought war and heartache
        Chakra ball I'm forming perfected
        Took more than a thousand hard days
        Konoha is under attack, I can't stand that
        Gotta save the woman that I love from a mad man
        Sacrifice our lives, that was always our plan
        Putting that Beast in my son, be the Yin to his Yang
        [Verse 5: Tsunade Senju (Twisted Savvy)]
        Hokage the Fifth, and I'm bringing it back
        Coming in fast with my seal as a mask
        Got enough strength to make a Susanoo crack
        Keepin' the peace, no time for setbacks
        Blood on my hands caused my mind to be stained
        Clan of the Senjus - I'm all that remains
        With the wisdom I gained I can show you the way
        I did this for you two becoming Hokage
        My appearance is irrelevant, you threatened by intelligence
        Known for my belligerence and bettin' my inheritance
        Knew I had potential since my adolescence
        Had a small jump start based on my descendance
        Everything I lost I will not forget
        Now it's my nindo that I must protect
        Old habits die hard, please, place your bets
        Believe it, Naruto, soon you'll be next
        With this kiss you have my affirmation
        And I won't abandon any of my companions
        Now it's Sakura's time, helpin' her awaken
        Kick rocks Orochimaru, that Jutsu's forbidden
        No room for error, can't miscalculate
        Need to research before I operate
        When I get stressed, I self medicate
        More paperwork? Take a sake break
        [Verse 6: Kakashi Hatake (Dreaded Yasuke)]
        Sixth! Comin' out the smoke, now you see my cloak
        Pull out my Kakashi flow, call me the Hokage the dope
        Never see me choke or going down a slope, correlate your scope
        Over the mountain top and see my face, now you can have a stroke (woo)
        Even though I lost my Sharingan - still got a thousand styles
        My profile been versatile since I joined in as a juvenile (juvenile)
        Minato can vouch any little doubt that you got in your soul
        All of my teammates in the clouds, better watch out when I'm on patrol (woo)
        Top ranks in the black ops in a tank top in the war zone
        You can try, but not gonna lie, got a hard time fighting Shadow Clones (Shadow Clones)
        Manifest purple lightning, piercing out like a sword (sword)
        But you're just wasting my time, Shikamaru, show 'em the door
        
        [Verse 7: Naruto Uzumaki (DizzyEight)]
        Yeah, I'm the GOAT, better know that, Six Paths, I control that
        Hope I fail, but I never will, so this L, my enemies can hold that
        I put the Village on my whole back, wanna die? Well, you Might, Guy
        But I'm nice, so I brought 'em all back, I pick up the slack when y'all lack
        Look, this how it had to be (had to be), the best what I had to be (what?)
        They named the show after me (oh), so I'm not afraid of anybody comin' after me
        The only one that's comin' after me is my son, and even then I still won (haha)
        'Cause my seed just another me, that's growing from everything I've done
        None of you Kage compare to me (ay)
        Uzumaki be the legacy (ay)
        Even a God couldn't handle me (ay)
        This is what destiny handed me (woah)
        Life tried to dismantle me (yo)
        But it didn't work, I just did work
        And it molded me to the man you see
        Greatest story of the century
