        [Monkey D. Luffy: Rustage]
        Starting with the number one, hey
        How'd a pirate get this long, hey
        'Cause I ate the Gum Gum
        See them run run when I hit that gun, hey
        Sailing, I'm talking no breaks
        When my crew's on the move
        As we pillage the Grand Line
        Looting the treasure we can find
        I'm blowing up like a landmine
        Going gear second
        I reckon that I'm a weapon
        I'm wrecking up those who threaten
        In messing with my own brethren
        Stay repping, look where I'm heading
        No question, the Yonkos sweating
        I'm betting the words I'm yelling
        I'm king and there's no forgetting
        
        [Gon Freecss: Fabvl]
        I'll jump the competition, really, there's no contest
        Channelled future Nen and most of y'all ain't even bomb yet
        It's nonsense
        Pro exams completed as a child
        Hisoka, I think these clowns are living in denial
        So don't make me power up, I'll call the thunder in my right hand
        If you want the strongest shonen, then you called the right man
        They might Stan
        Treat you all like Pitou, it won't take long
        Name is Gon and this time, Imma make sure that you stay gone

        Drake
        The Real Slim Shady
        Eminem
        [Naruto Uzumaki: None Like Joshua]
        Oh, better believe it's Naruto
        Who's the best hero all of you know
        My legacy is happening
        I got a type of running named after me
        While you're slow
        Can't keep up with my chakra flow
        Except Hinata, I'm her ho-
        Kage, all I did is call her and I told her to come over
        'Cause my parents are not home
        Out of these ninjas, you can watch my dub
        Even all my filler is so far above
        When it comes to Boruto, why y'all given up
        Like I did with simpin' on Sakura
        Killer B's rapping, but I get the encore
        With the power that I bring, I don't really want yours
        'Cause I came from the swing, everybody shunned more
        Now you're looking at the king of this Jump Force
        
        [Yugi Muto: Connor Quest!]
        Imma master, you be
        Practice newbies
        That's a doozy for Yami Yugi
        Puzzle did something like a Hadron tunnel
        'Cause now I got Atem through me
        Champ of the match, see fans fawn
        No matter what hand's drawn
        I'm kicking up dust, metal tanks in land form
        When we d-d-d-d-duel, there's sandstorms
        Cards are flipping, I need an answer quick and
        I might find my Dark Magician
        If I wish hard and believe enough in the heart that's in 'em
        I see Seto's fear
        Pull the fifth part of Exodia
        Guess it all came to a head so clear
        That your deck's gonna get X'd, oh dear
        [Asta Staria: Eddie Rath]
        Welcome to the magic
        It's a tale that's tragic
        Filled with the pain that's harder than plastic
        Especially when you discover that you don't have it
        When I started, I was less than amazing
        But now that I've been chosen by the grimoire
        I'm rising to the occasion in a blazing flame of magic
        Ain't no hocus pocus and abracadabra
        Not a wizard you joke with
        This is not Gandalf the Gray, but you shall not pass hopeless
        Better be ferocious
        Was the poorest orphan living in darkness
        But now that I'm focused, I be thanking all my hardships
        
        [Ichigo Kurosaki: IBDL]
        Uh, hittin' back with that Bankai
        Got that power like it came out of the Dangai
        Pops passed the torch, now I'm the fam's don guy
        Think you Aizen, but you looking like that Don guy
        Y'all like Soi Fon, your raps barely sting
        My bars are Getsuga Tensho, got that masterful swing
        They say it ain't over till the fat lady sings
        But you'll know it's really over when that black lady sings
        
        [Koro-Sensei: CDawgVA]
        Mach speed, blow up the moon
        Now I'm making these children write essays
        Coming with tentacles, teach you a lesson
        In why you don't mess with the sensei
        I amaze, used to be the reaper, now I run this class
        I can turn a loser to assassin, do it real fast
        [Light Yagami: Zach B]
        I think I've been out of my head
        Gift was given, made some poor decisions
        That I wish I didn't, but I do it again
        Feeling different, I was on a mission
        To achieve my vision with a page and a pen
        Sit and listen to the words I've written
        I ain't even finished 'till I see that they're dead
        Don't even try to pretend, there's no malicious intent
        Stay in my thoughts, stick to the morals I've got
        And kill anyone who is not
        Just never get caught until every criminal rots
        They'll consider me as a god
        At whatever cost, that's how I excel
        Cannot be stopped even if I fell
        I'm taking 'em off, if you couldn't tell
        I gave up a lot to give you this L
        
        [Shoyo Hinata: Shwabadi]
        Yeah, here comes Hinata
        When I'm on the court, the enemy has got their guard up
        Never gonna fall off, bet I'm gonna pop off
        Way short, but I'm packing punches like a sawed-off
        Hot like a sauna, this ball of fire
        Don't know nada, but I'm gonna chase desire
        To go farther every jump will take me higher
        They put walls up, so I had to learn to fly
        Putting up points, spiking it or clearing the way
        Best decoy, got a little something to say
        To anyone that doubts that I'm here to stay
        Only got one goal: it's to play the game
        Underestimated, I'm the ace, you just wait
        When I spike it past the net
        You might take it to the face
        
        [Izuku Midoriya: Divide Music]
        Coming in with 100% of me
        I got you all trembling
        Just with a flick of my finger
        Put you back where you're supposed to be
        I'm not holding back
        I got you so calculated
        I'm one step ahead
        One For All gon' be demonstrated
        Get it? Got it? Good
        Nothing better, and you should know
        Started at the bottom, but I made it to the top, so
        Step aside, I'm climbing to great heights
        With All Might at my side
        Repping UA With pride, oh
        
        [Yusuke Urameshi: GameboyJones]
        Giving you the finger, spirit gun
        Send you off with Botan, then you done
        Hit you with the stick and I didn't need a grip
        When I'm pulling from the hip, then click
        Because I'm lock, loaded, the clip is ready to go
        Got a shotgun in my hand that's 'bout to blow
        'Cause I'm hitting you quick, fast
        Giving you whiplash wearing these spirit cuffs
        You can be human or demon
        'Cause honestly, I just don't give a f***
        If you're looking for the best, just know there's no other
        'Cause I'm flexing out here like I'm the youngest Toguro brother
        
        [Gintoki Sakata: Shao Dow]
        They call me Gintoki, slim, not stocky
        Lemme Shonen Jump on your leg and your body
        Odd Job Gin, don't mess with my posse
        If you touch my hair, then you will be sorry
        ね, ぼけ (Huh? Dumbass)
        何これ, うるせえな (What the hell is this? Shut your mouth)
        'Cause you're way too sloppy
        Got a silver soul, Shiroyasha
        Swing my sword and Amanto scatter
        Gintama, not Kintama
        Tell Shinpachi we need money
        If Kagura or Katsura bring more trouble, we keep running
        Pay rent? That's a waste of time
        That weather girl, I will make her mine
        You can beat me up and that's fair and fine
        But if you hurt my friends, then prepare to die
        
        [Tanjiro Kamado: DizzyEight]
        Look, slaying demons, that's what we do
        If you filled with evil, then my blade is highly lethal
        If you coming at my people, pray to God I never meet you
        Ever mess with Nez, you KO'd when I see you
        I've grown stronger from that fateful day they found me
        I trained hard to hone my skill, the progression so outstanding
        My style like breathing water, that mean you can never drown me
        Whirlpool, that mean I'm slicing everything around me
        
        [Emma: FrivolousShara]
        E-M-M-A, 63194
        Listen what I've got to say
        The others walked seems, now we gotta run away
        Don't you talk, adults are the enemy
        You can break every bone in my body, I won't falter
        And if the plan fails, the idea simply alters
        These demons scheming, but they ain't the only monsters
        Our combined IQ breaks the safe, strength in numbers
        Now we've woken from the slumber
        Never ending perfect summers
        Across the farm, you can't help but wonder
        
        [Soma Yukihira: Diggz Da Prophecy]
        See, I'm the anime Raekwon
        The chef, baby, stay calm
        You can't stand the heat? Get out the kitchen, get a day job
        Word, and the finale's superb
        I take a sec, put on my band and I'll be happy to serve
        So ma, tell me what you like and I can hook it up
        Ya boy got them recipes the best couldn't cook it up
        And she gon' bust from the taste of my meat
        Chef, boy are these boys always cooking up heat
        
        [Jotaro Kujo: Dreaded Yasuke]
        It's my go, they call me Jotaro
        Don't get me mad, I'ma go fast only with jabs
        You go through silos
        Got that drip from Cairo, girls will simp my silhouette
        I don't think it's a typo fighting with a platinum psycho
        None of y'all is a threat
        What you gotta say in your breath
        Better speak with a bigger chest
        Now you lying down with my pet, while Iggy piss on ya neck
        All types of disrespect, what you expect
        Go against a vet, better get your techs
        Wanna get swept through the complex
        Now who is next?
        
        [Bobobo: BassedOlaf w/ ThighHighSenpai]
        Bobobo making the foes stare
        Call me the master of nose hair
        Look at the hair on the heads of these anime characters
        Brother, it's no fair
        But I'm better than these guys, don't you understand?
        I came second place at screaming face to face with desk fans
        Afro is full of surprises, look at my powers immense
        Leaving Beauty screaming
        Bobobo, that makes no sense
        Hunting Hair Hunters, Saitama, I'm coming for you
        Don patch a better Super Saiyan God than Goku
        
        [Goku (Kakarot): DaddyPhatSnaps]
        Oh, they went and called Kakarot, had to be danger
        Leave 'em flat footed like they in the gravity chamber
        I'm just looking for a challenge, can you battle me, stranger?
        Shonen Legend in the Saddle and the power is major
        Level up on the track, flow Ultra Instinct
        Bye, bye, bye, fusion dance is always in sync
        *wink*
        And they wonder why I'm last on the song
        'Cause when all of y'all were talking, I just formed a Spirit Bomb
