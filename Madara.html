    <h1>Lyrics</h1>
    <pre>
        All of ya ninjas should know me
        You're on a level below me
        I'm like oni
        You are phoney
        Oh please
        I'm one and only
        Look at me, ghostly
        You make me go sleep
        Why don't you go be
        Something less lowly
        Cus you know low key
        Senju they owe me
        I'm the true god of shinobi
        Hah
        Mowing down these armies, alarming
        It's like I'm farming
        Their arming themselves with weapons
        Disarming them when I get em
        I'm betting I'm better battering bodies badder
        I'm starting departing their souls
        Parting them whole
        Crushing their skulls
        I'm scary
        Activate my sharingan, mangekyou eternal
        Cutting out your organs so the bleeding is external
        Choke you in a minute so your face be turning purple
        Ninja info cards?
        It would be more like a journal
        Combining chakras my rinnegans activated
        I've waited now I'm reincarnated
        Hatred is burning what's sacred
        Preta
        Deva
        Six paths getter
        Let a
        Pressure
        Crush your center
        I've got a plan of action
        Passion is born through endeavour
        Bringer of peace
        I'm unleashing the beasts
        God Mode
        Rah
        You are deceased
        Now that my power's increased
        God Mode
        Rah
        I can't be beat
        Bodies they lay at my feet
        God Mode
        Rah
        Chakra release
        Betting you wanna retreat
        God Mode
        Rah
        Bringer of peace
        I'm unleashing the beasts
        God Mode
        Rah
        You are deceased
        Now that my power's increased
        God Mode
        Rah
        I can't be beat
        Bodies they lay at my feet
        God Mode
        Rah
        Chakra release
        Betting you wanna retreat
        God Mode
        Rah
        I was born in to war
        My brothers blood on the floor
        I was a child, so it is wild
        That I'd be used to the gore
        Never had a friend like you
        Didn't share my clan and you hid yours too
        Sharing our stories, we're making it do
        Picture a world where the fighting was through
        Ending our friendship so I'd have no problem
        When I have to kill you
        Rah
        I'm an uchiha, so this is where we are
        And I have the will too
        Rah
        So even when you're putting up your life
        With a knife in your side
        Open eyes for a better world
        There is never something we decide
        Wanna lie?
        Peace can only happen when I'm in control
        Konoha's a failed experiment, do you understand?
        Uchiha are in fear whilst the senju make demands
        Take a stand
        I'm coming through, you defend
        I do not care if we used to be friends
        What I intend
        About to descend
        Battle me in the valley of the end
        Bringer of peace
        I'm unleashing the beasts
        God Mode
        Rah
        You are deceased
        Now that my power's increased
        God Mode
        Rah
        I can't be beat
        Bodies they lay at my feet
        God Mode
        Rah
        Chakra release
        Betting you wanna retreat
        God Mode
        Rah
        Bringer of peace
        I'm unleashing the beasts
        God Mode
        Rah
        You are deceased
        Now that my power's increased
        God Mode
        Rah
        I can't be beat
        Bodies they lay at my feet
        God Mode
        Rah
        Chakra release
        Betting you wanna retreat
        God Mode
        Bringer of peace
        I'm unleashing the beasts
        You are deceased
        Now that my power's increased
        I can't be beat
        Bodies they lay at my feet
        Chakra release
        Betting you wanna retreat
